\title{Optimisation of the objective function}
\usage{
hazl_ker_old(yd, alpha0, Wik, Zik, Xh, XH, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{yd}{- data}

\item{alpha0}{- initial solution value for the B-spline coefficients}

\item{Wik}{- matrix as calculated by bspline_regression_basis_functions()}

\item{Zik}{- matrix as calculated by bspline_regression_basis_functions()}

\item{Xh}{- matrix as calculated by bspline_regression_basis_functions()}

\item{XH}{- matrix as calculated by bspline_regression_basis_functions()}

\item{verbose}{- Boolean; if TRUE, the convergence of the two used optimisation routines is reported.}
}
\value{
list(alpha1,h,S,m2loglik) - alpha1 is the new solution;
using alpha1, the function also calculates the hazard (h), survival (S) and objective function and gradient (m2loglik) ;
